This is my first game, Delivery Driver.

Instructions:

1. Your aim is to deliver all the packages
2. The pink boxes are the packages
3. The blue box is the destination
4. Your car will turn purple if you have a package and blue if you don't
5. The orange bars are speed boosters
6. Crashes will slow you down

GOOD LUCK DRIVER!!!

(PS : no pause menu so alt+f4 to quit)
